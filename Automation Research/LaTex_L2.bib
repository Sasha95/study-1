abstract = {Determination of mobility edge in presence of metal-to-insulator transition Recombination dynamics of excitons was studied in multiple narrow quantum well GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. Disorder generated by interface roughness considerably affects transport of the conduction band electrons and at appropriate quantum well width results in a metal-to insulator transition. Localization of the electrons was found to be responsible for the exciton recombination time measured in the vicinity of the metal-to-insulator transition. Measurement of the exciton recombination time as a function of the energy allowed for determination of the critical energy of the mobility edge attributed to the conduction band electrons. The mobility edge energy obtained in this way demonstrates intersection with the Fermi level energy at the critical disorder corresponding to the metal-to-insulator transition.},

abstract = {We investigate the surface roughness and dislocation distribution of compositionally graded relaxed SiGe buffer layers by inserting two tensile-strained Si layers. The 20nm thick strained Si layers, less than the critical thickness for dislocation formation, are inserted at 10 and 20{\%} Ge content regions of the 1$\mu$m thick graded SiGe layer with a final Ge content of 30{\%}. The surface immediately after growing the second strained Si layer on SiGe with 20{\%} Ge content is found to be flat with about 1.1nm root-mean-square roughness. However, the crosshatched surface with the 7.8nm roughness develops during subsequent SiGe growths, which is slightly less than the 10.3nm value for SiGe without inserted Si layers. Another important issue of consideration is that inserting the strained Si layers leads to increased interaction among dislocations as shown by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. This study explores the possibility of using strained layers for achieving flat surfaces and illustrates the nee...},

@article{Penner1999,
abstract = {Interface roughness strongly influences the transport properties of thin quantum wells. The commonly used model of interface roughness scattering approximates the well potential by infinitely high barriers. By using SiGe as an example, we demonstrate that this approximation strongly overestimates interface roughness scattering for narrow quantum wells. Our calculations show that the low-temperature mobilities of two-dimensional hole gases in SiGe and of electrons in strained Si quantum wells are limited by interface roughness scattering for well widths below 20-50 Angstrom. The discussed effect of finite barrier heights on carrier scattering should be considered in transport investigations of materials such as GaAs/AlGaAs and Si/SiGe, when the well width is in the range of 100 Angstrom or below.},
